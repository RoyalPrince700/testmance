    {
      question: 'What is the primary purpose of biological classification?',
      options: [
        'To create confusion among scientists',
        'To organize and identify organisms systematically',

        'To separate plants from animals only'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'Biological classification helps scientists organize, identify, and study the vast diversity of living organisms in a systematic way.',

      options: [
        'They are made of cells',
        'They can move',
        'They exhibit all characteristics of life simultaneously',
        'They have complex structures'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: 'Living organisms exhibit all characteristics of life (organization, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response, reproduction) simultaneously.',

      question: 'The scientific name of an organism consists of:',
      options: [
        'Common name only',
        'Genus name only',
        'Genus and species names',
        'Family and order names'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: 'The scientific name (binomial nomenclature) consists of the genus name (capitalized) followed by the species name (lowercase).',
