            This chapter concentrates on the techniques for writing all form of essays, letters, reports and other academic course works requiring a step-by-step method of pre-writing, writing and re- writing. Of all the skills of communication, writing is the most difficult because it demands meticulous effort and painstaking commitment to accomplish.

            Writing essays does not mean using long words and lofty phrases. Matthew Arnold cited in Collinson (1986, p.144) advises that "Have something to say and say it as clearly as you can". There is no single, universal and exclusive set in which an essay should be written, but certainly, writing requires a form or shape for it to be meaningful.

              Writing is of various categories. Its dominant characteristics are the audience, subject matter, and purpose. The different kinds of writing include essays namely: (Narrative, Descriptive, Argumentative, and Expository), letters (Formal and Informal), creative writing, business correspondence, news reports, feature articles, editorials, advertisements, press release, technical and research reports among others. For effective communication, all learners must be adequately familiar with the skills of writing already enumerated above.

It is the preliminary stage where the writer assembles relevant ideas that could serve the purpose of developing a coherent discourse. The activity at this stage is brain-storming.

            Writing is the second stage that launches the writer into the real business. This is also the segment where the writer arranges ideas in logical paragraphs. Essay must be developed coherently in such a way that there is a free flow of thought from one level to another. The stage requires the writer to prepare a meaningful draft that follows the order of the beginning, body and conclusion.

              <p class="text-blue-800 leading-relaxed">
                The advice is that the writer must avoid an haphazardly combined string of sentences with disjointed paragraphs and ungrammatical expressions that make mutual intelligibility difficult to achieve. Writing requires the rules of meaningful expression be carefully done. It also involves an avoidance of the pitfalls that typify bad writing.

              In the words of Collinson (1986, p.157), the good writer is someone who has paragraphs varied in length, development and organization. He lets me know where he is going, moves quickly through the simple materials, and explain and illustrates more difficult points. His paragraphs are carefully connected, and when there is a marked change in thought, there are enough indications to help me follow the shift. He does not repeat unnecessarily or digress; instead, he covers his subject thoroughly and briefly. While I am still interested, he completes his work in a satisfactory final paragraph and leaves me wishing that there were more writers like him.
