            There is no gainsaying that languages of the world share certain similarities such as having letters of alphabet, speech sounds, word classes, vocabulary and grammar, and that letters of alphabet of any language is used in the formation of its words while the speech sounds are for the pronunciation of words. Nonetheless, every language has its phonotactics or the rules of grammar that guide its vocabulary and grammatical construction. This means that the way features in language are harnessed differ from language to language.

            Ah! Welcome to the exciting world of ICT in language learning, my dear 100level students! 🎉 Imagine you're in your village market - all the traders are there, but each one speaks their own language - Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, or even Pidgin English. That's exactly how languages work globally - they share some basic similarities (like having letters and sounds), but each has its own "market rules" (phonotactics and grammar) that make them unique!

              See, we Nigerians are blessed with multiple languages - Yoruba with its tonal beauty 🎵, Igbo with its musical rhythm, Hausa with its straightforwardness. But English? Na wah o! It's like a stubborn goat that doesn't follow our familiar patterns. ICT is here to help us bridge this gap in this digital age!

Internet can be expensive, devices are costly, and not everyone has access. But here's the good news - we're overcoming these challenges every day. Our "Nigerian factor" (improvisation and resilience) is our secret weapon! 🇳🇬⚡

This is your roadmap to becoming a true scholar. Think of references as the foundation of a building - without them, the whole structure collapses.

              References are like the roots of a tree - they provide nourishment and stability. Every idea in this chapter (and in your education) comes from somewhere. References tell you where. They show respect for other scholars' work, help you verify information, and guide you to learn more. In academic writing, references are like giving credit where credit is due - it's honest and honorable!
