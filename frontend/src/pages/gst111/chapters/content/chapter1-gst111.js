            There is no gainsaying that languages of the world share certain similarities such as having letters of alphabet, speech sounds, word classes, vocabulary and grammar, and that letters of alphabet of any language is used in the formation of its words while the speech sounds are for the pronunciation of words. Nonetheless, every language has its phonotactics or the rules of grammar that guide its vocabulary and grammatical construction. This means that the way features in language are harnessed differ from language to language.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            For example, unlike English language, Nigerian languages such as Yoruba and Igbo are one to one correspondence, that is, the way a word is spelt in Igbo and Yoruba is the way it is pronounced but the way a word is spelt in English may not be the way it is pronounced. Igbo has 36 letters of alphabet, so also the number of its speech sounds; Yoruba has 25 letters of alphabet, so also its speech sounds; but English has 26 letters of Alphabet with 44 speech sounds. Igbo, Yoruba and many other Nigerian language are tonal languages while English is stress and intonationally patterned.

            Hey there, my dear student! 😊 Welcome to the fascinating world of English phonology. Imagine you're trying to learn how to cook a new dish - you need to understand each ingredient and how they work together, right? That's exactly what we're doing here with English sounds!

              See, unlike our beloved Nigerian languages like Yoruba, Igbo, and Hausa where spelling matches pronunciation perfectly, English is like a mischievous trickster! One letter can make different sounds, and some sounds need different spellings. This difference often confuses us Nigerians when learning English.

            <p class="text-yellow-800">
              In our Nigerian languages, we use tone to change meaning (like in Yoruba: "bàtà" vs "batà"). But English uses stress and intonation instead. That's why we sometimes sound "flat" when speaking English - we're not using the right musical elements!

            <p class="text-indigo-800 leading-relaxed">
              Articulatory Phonetics is that branch of Phonetics that studies the production of human sounds made with the organs of speech. All speech sounds are made within the human organs of speech provided the human vocal tract is capable of producing it and the human ear is capable of hearing it.
            </p>
            <p class="text-indigo-800 leading-relaxed mt-3">
              English speech sounds are made by manipulating air as it is exhaled from the lungs. The air that pushes the produced sounds may or may not encounter certain constrictions or blockage. Vowel sounds of English are classified as oral sounds because they are produced without any form of constriction of the airstream in the oral cavity, but with rigorous obstruction mounted around the larynx (i.e. the Adam's apple), which causes the vibration of the vocal chords. The vibration of the vocal folds results to the vowel sounds being voiced.

            <p class="text-yellow-800">
              On the other hand, consonant sounds of English are produced with obstructions which can be complete or partial. The blockage becomes complete, when two articulators come together to produce sound without any available space for air to escape until the sound is produced as in the case of stops/plosives. While the obstruction can be partial while two organs of speech meet to produce sounds as in the case of fricatives and affricates and some others.

              In our languages, we have fewer vowel sounds, and they're usually pure. English has more vowels, and some "slide" from one to another (diphthongs). That's why we sometimes say "house" like "haus" instead of "hows" - we're not used to that gliding! 🇳🇬➡️🇬🇧

            Diphthongs are what make English sound musical and flowing! Unlike our Nigerian languages where vowels stay pure, English vowels often "dance" from one sound to another. Practice saying these words slowly, feeling the glide - it's like learning to dance! 💃🕺

              Intonation is used to describe the fall and rise of pitch in speech. It can also be referred to as variation in speech. Wale (2001, p. 221) says that "intonation is used to convey attitudinal meaning, illocutionary force, grammatical structure and information value". This means that intonation conveys the mood of the speaker to his audience.
