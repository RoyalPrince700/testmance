            Listening is taken for granted mainly because people fail to differentiate between the two concepts of hearing and listening. They also forget the fact that listening requires more than the hearing of speech sounds. Hearing does not require much effort since the auditory organs are not impaired for the sound waves to pass through.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Hearing is the mere process by which sound waves are received and relayed along the nervous system of the ear. Hearing covers picking out all forms of sound around us irrespective of the source of the sound. Listening on the other hand, is the process of directing attention to the sound contrasts produced by the human organs of speech and their sequences.

              Beyond sounds, listening is the ability to differentiate between the dictionary meaning of words and the meaning words acquire when used in connected speech. This distinction is crucial for effective communication and comprehension.

            Ehen! My dear 100-level student, welcome to the world of listening skills! 😊 Imagine you're in a crowded Nigerian market - you hear all kinds of sounds: hawkers shouting "Buy my tomatoes!", cars honking, music playing from speakers, people talking in Yoruba, Igbo, and Hausa. That's hearing! But when you focus on what your lecturer is saying in class, or when your friend is telling you important information, that's listening!

            <p class="text-red-800">
              See, many Nigerians think hearing and listening are the same thing. "I hear you!" we say, but we might not really be listening. In our Nigerian culture, we hear the church bell, mosque call to prayer, and our neighbors' gossip, but we don't always listen to understand. This is especially tricky for us when learning English!

            In our Nigerian languages, we have tonal differences that change meaning. In Yoruba, "bàtà" means "shoe" with low tone, but "bátà" means "to scatter" with high tone. English has similar sound contrasts, but they work differently. When we listen, we must pay attention to these sound differences and the meaning they create in sentences.

            Ah! Now we're getting to the heart of the matter! 🔄 Listening isn't just one thing - it's a complete process that flows like water from one stage to another. Think of it like how we process information in a Nigerian family meeting: first you hear the words, then you think about what they mean, then you respond appropriately. That's the listening communication process, and it's crucial for your success as a student!

            Ah ah! This section hits close to home! 🏫 As Nigerian students learning English as a second language, listening is especially challenging for us. The sounds, stress patterns, and speech styles of English are different from our beautiful Nigerian languages. But don't worry - understanding these challenges is the first step to overcoming them. "E go better!" Let's explore why listening is tricky for us and how we can master it!

              Many of us struggle with English listening because we try to fit English sounds into our native language patterns. A Yoruba speaker might hear English "p" as "kp," or an Igbo speaker might miss the stress patterns. But here's the good news: with awareness and practice, we can become excellent English listeners. Every successful Nigerian professional you admire went through this journey!
