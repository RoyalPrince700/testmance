        'Only oro-nasal process for the nasal sounds'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'Complex words like "psychology" require coordination of all three processes: airstream for sound initiation, phonation for voicing distinctions, and oro-nasal for oral vs nasal sound production.',
      points: 2
    },
    {
      question: 'A learner pronounces "enough" as /ɪˈnʌf/ instead of /ɪˈnʌf/. What phonological awareness does this demonstrate?',

    },
    {
      question: 'In "education", where should primary stress be applied and why?',
      options: [
        'On "ed" because it\'s the first syllable',
        'On "ca" because it contains the most complex vowel sound',
        'On "tion" because it\'s a derivational suffix requiring stress',
        'On "u" because it\'s the vowel closest to the word root'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: 'Derivational suffixes like "-tion" often attract primary stress in English words, demonstrating the phonological rule that suffix stress can change word meaning and pronunciation.',

      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'The student is replacing /ð/ (dental fricative) with /d/ (alveolar plosive). They need to learn to place the tongue tip between the teeth with light friction for the correct sound.',
      points: 2
    },
    {
      question: 'In the question "You don\'t understand?↗", what intonation pattern should be used and why?',
      options: [
        'Falling tune because it\'s a statement',
        'Rising tune because it seeks confirmation of understanding',
        'Level tune because it\'s a tag question',
        'No intonation change needed'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'Tag questions seeking confirmation use rising intonation to invite agreement or correction, demonstrating pragmatic use of suprasegmental features.',
      points: 2
    },
    {
      question: 'When pronouncing "photography", which syllable receives secondary stress and what linguistic principle explains this?',
      options: [
        'No secondary stress is needed',
        'Primary stress on "graph", secondary on "pho"',
        'Equal stress on all syllables',
        'Primary stress on "to", secondary on "pho"'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'In compound words or words with multiple morphemes, secondary stress often appears on earlier elements while primary stress goes to the main stressed syllable, following English stress rules.',
      points: 2
    },
    {
      question: 'A learner says "I have went" instead of "I have gone". What grammatical-phonological confusion is evident?',

        'Article selection principles',
        'Plural marker application'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 0,
      explanation: 'This shows confusion between regular past tense forms ("went") and irregular past participles ("gone"), where phonological rules for tense markers don\'t apply to irregular verbs.',
      points: 2
    },
    {
      question: 'In teaching consonant clusters like "str" in "street", what articulatory sequencing must be learned?',
      options: [
        'Simultaneous production of all three sounds',
        'Sequential but overlapping articulation from alveolar to dental to alveolar',
        'Voiced-voiceless-voiced sequence',
        'Complete blockage followed by gradual release'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'Consonant clusters require precise articulatory sequencing where sounds blend smoothly. In "str-", the /s/ (alveolar), /t/ (dental), and /r/ (alveolar) must be produced in rapid succession.',
      points: 2
    },
    {
      question: 'When a Nigerian learner pronounces "this" as /dis/, what systematic phonological intervention is most effective?',
      options: [
        'Memorization of individual words',
        'Training in dental fricative production with minimal pairs practice',
        'Elimination of all voiced consonants',
        'Focus on vowel sounds only'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'This is a systematic error affecting the /ð/ vs /d/ contrast. Minimal pairs practice (this/thick, that/dat) combined with articulatory training for dental fricatives provides the most effective intervention.',
      points: 2
    },
    {
      question: 'In the command "Sit down now!↘", why is falling intonation crucial for communicative effectiveness?',
      options: [
        'It makes the command sound more polite',
        'It signals finality and authority, preventing misinterpretation as a question',
        'It reduces the volume of the speaker\'s voice',
        'It indicates the speaker is unsure'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'Falling intonation in commands signals completion and authority. Without it, the utterance might be interpreted as a question rather than a directive, demonstrating how suprasegmental features affect pragmatic meaning.',
      points: 2
    },
    {
      question: 'A student pronounces "library" as /ˈlaɪbrəri/ instead of /ˈlaɪbrɛri/. What phonotactic rule needs reinforcement?',
