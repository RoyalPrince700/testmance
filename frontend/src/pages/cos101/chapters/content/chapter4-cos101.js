            "Diverse and Growing Computers" simply refers to the wide range of computing devices, systems and technologies that are constantly evolving to meet various needs and applications. Similarly, it is the increasing representation of underrepresented groups (such as women, people of color, individuals with disabilities) in the field of computer science and technology industry, and the development of more inclusive design teams and technologies.

            Thus, data diversity refers to the range of different types of elements in a dataset. The causes behind the growing importance of computer could be traced to their versatility, efficiency, ability to process vast amounts of information at incredible speeds, crucial technology, highway and telecommunication services. Computers save our valuable time in any work.
