        'Scientiae',
        'Scientiarum',
        'Scientis'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 0,
      explanation: 'The word "science" is derived from the Latin word "scientia" meaning knowledge.',
      points: 1
    },
    {
      question: 'According to the chapter, what are the three cardinal aims of science?',
      options: [
        'Observation, Experimentation, Conclusion',
        'Prediction, Control, Explanation',
        'Hypothesis, Theory, Law',
        'Data, Analysis, Interpretation'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'The three cardinal aims of science are prediction, control, and explanation. Of these, explanation is considered the greatest.',
      points: 1
    },
    {
      question: 'Which of the following is NOT one of the three methods for studying philosophical science mentioned in the chapter?',
      options: [
        'The Pedestrian Method',
        'The Critical Method',
        'The Original Philosophical Method',
        'The Empirical Method'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 3,
      explanation: 'The three methods are: (a) The Pedestrian Method (discussing topics), (b) The Critical Method (examining assumptions), and (c) The Original Philosophical Method (injecting philosophical notions).',
      points: 1
    },
    {
      question: 'Who proposed the Deductive-Nomological (D-N) model of scientific explanation?',
      options: [
        'Isaac Newton and Galileo Galilei',
        'Carl G. Hempel and Paul Oppenheim',
        'Francis Bacon and René Descartes',
        'Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'The Deductive-Nomological (D-N) model was put forward by Carl G. Hempel and Paul Oppenheim in 1948. It says that a scientific explanation succeeds by subsuming a phenomenon under a general law.',
      points: 1
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the key difference between the D-N model and the IS (Inductive-Statistical) model?',
      options: [
        'D-N is inductive, IS is deductive',
        'D-N is deductive and entails the explanandum, while IS is inductive and confers high probability',
        'D-N uses statistics, IS uses logic',
        'There is no difference'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'A D-N explanation is a deductive argument entailing the explanandum, while an IS explanation is an inductive argument conferring high probability on the explanandum.',
      points: 1
    },
    {
      question: 'According to the chapter, what is one of the shortcomings of the D-N account?',
      options: [
        'It requires too much mathematical knowledge',
        'It is unable to account for judgments of explanatory relevance',
        'It only works for physics',
        'It is too simple'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'One of the objections to the D-N theory is its inability to account for judgments of explanatory relevance. Other objections include insufficient attention to causal relations and the requirement that every explanation cite a law.',
      points: 1
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the basis for validity of scientific explanations according to the chapter?',
      options: [
        'Popular opinion',
        'Mathematical proof only',
        'Empirical verification and inductive reasoning',
        'Philosophical arguments alone'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: 'Science relies on empirical verification (evidence and repeatable observations) and inductive reasoning (generalizing from observations) to validate its theories and models.',
      points: 1
    },
    {
      question: 'According to the chapter, how does science achieve objectivity in observations?',
      options: [
        'By relying solely on human senses',
        'By using measuring devices and reducing human involvement',
        'By avoiding all measurements',
        'By using only theoretical models'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'Science achieves objectivity by using measuring devices (spectrometers, voltmeters, computers, etc.) and reducing human involvement in the measuring process. The less human involvement, the more accurate and reliable the data.',
      points: 1
    },
    {
      question: 'What does the Statistical Relevance model emphasize?',
      options: [
        'Logical deduction only',
        'High probability only',
        'The relevance of various factors as a comparative concept',
        'Mathematical equations'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: 'The Statistical Relevance model emphasizes statistical relevance as an objective relation and a comparative concept, focusing on how relevant certain factors are to the occurrence of an event.',
      points: 1
    },
    {
      question: 'According to the chapter, what is philosophy of science concerned with?',
      options: [
        'Only the history of science',
        'Only scientific experiments',
        'The assumptions, foundations, methods, and implications of science',
        'Only mathematical proofs'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: 'Philosophy of science is concerned with the assumptions, foundations, methods, and implications of science. It can be simply defined as critical discussion of the various developments in science.',
