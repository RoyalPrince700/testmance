    {
      question: 'According to the chapter, matter is defined as anything that occupies space and possesses:',
      options: [
        'Only mass',
        'Only inertia',
        'Mass and offers resistance to change of inertia',
        'Only sensory perception'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: 'Matter is defined as anything that occupies space, possesses mass of its own, offers resistance to change of inertia, and may be felt by sensory organs.',

      question: 'Which of the following is NOT a property of living matter mentioned in the chapter?',
      options: [
        'Respiration',
        'Growth',
        'Metabolism',
        'Crystallization'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 3,
      explanation: 'Living matter exhibits properties like respiration, growth, movement, metabolism (eating and excretion), and reproduction. Crystallization is a property of non-living matter.',

    {
      question: 'Which of the following is NOT a type of pure substance according to the chapter?',
      options: [
        'Elements',
        'Compounds',
        'Homogeneous mixtures',
        'Heterogeneous mixtures'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: 'Pure substances include elements (e.g., hydrogen) and compounds (e.g., H₂O). Mixtures are further classified as homogeneous or heterogeneous.',

    {
      question: 'According to the kinetic theory of matter, particles in a solid state:',
      options: [
        'Move randomly in all directions',
        'Vibrate and rotate about a mean position only',
        'Vibrate, rotate, and slide over each other easily',
        'Have no motion at all'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'In solids, particles only vibrate and rotate about a mean position. In liquids, they can also slide over each other, and in gases, they move randomly in all directions.',
      points: 1
    },
    {
      question: 'Which of the following is NOT one of the fundamental assumptions of the kinetic theory?',
      options: [
        'Particle dimension is much less than the distance between collisions',
        'Particle velocity is large such that there are many collisions',
        'Particles have mutual attraction forces between them',
        'Collisions between particles are perfectly elastic'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: 'The kinetic theory assumes that separation between particles is large such that mutual Coulombic (charged particle) forces of attraction or repulsion are negligible, not that they have attraction forces.',

    {
      question: 'Matter can exist in how many physical states according to the chapter?',
      options: [
        'Two states',
        'Three states',
        'Four states',
        'Five states'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'Matter exists in three physical states: solid, liquid, and gas or plasma. Each state is distinguished by temperature and appearance.',
      points: 1
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the key difference between physical change and chemical change?',
      options: [
        'Physical change involves state transformation, chemical change involves fundamental transformation',
        'Physical change is reversible, chemical change is not',
        'Physical change involves energy, chemical change does not',
        'There is no difference'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 0,
      explanation: 'Physical change involves transformation of state (e.g., solid to liquid) while chemical change results in a fundamentally different matter (e.g., rusting of iron).',
      points: 1
    },
    {
      question: 'Which subatomic particle has a negative charge and the smallest mass?',
      options: [
        'Proton',
        'Neutron',
        'Electron',
        'Nucleus'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: 'The electron has a negative charge (-1) and the smallest mass (9.1 × 10⁻³¹ kg). Protons are positive and heavier, neutrons are neutral and heavy.',

    {
      question: 'Nuclear fission involves:',
      options: [
        'Splitting of a nucleus into two or more smaller nuclei',
        'Combining of two or more nuclei to form a heavier nucleus',
        'Emission of alpha and beta particles only',
        'Conversion of mass to energy without nuclear change'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 0,
      explanation: 'Nuclear fission is the division/splitting of a nucleus into two or more smaller nuclei, while fusion involves combining nuclei. Both release about 1,000,000 times more energy than chemical changes.',
      points: 1
    },
    {
      question: 'What principle explains the mass defect observed during nuclear reactions?',
      options: [
        'Law of conservation of mass',
        'Law of conservation of energy',
        'Einstein\'s E = mc² principle',
        'Newton\'s laws of motion'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: 'Einstein showed that mass defect (Δm) converts to energy according to E = Δmc². This restates the conservation law: mass and energy are equivalent and can convert between forms.',
