            Welcome to the fascinating study of <strong>Geomorphology of Africa</strong>! 🌟 The physical environment
            of an area is as important as the people living within it. Features like hills, valleys, and plain surfaces
            are products of natural and/or artificial activities, creating beautiful landscapes that sometimes serve
            as tourist centers, such as Zuma Rock in Nigeria.

              Almost every state in Nigeria and countries in Africa has its peculiarity in terms of landscape.
              As students and citizens of Africa, it's important to understand variations in landscape characteristics
              from region to region and the origins of elements like mountains, valleys, and river systems in our
              physical environment.

            the landforms and forms under the ocean and the physical, chemical, and biological factors such as weathering,
            erosion, and wave actions that act on them.
